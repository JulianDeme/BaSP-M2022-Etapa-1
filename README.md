# Trackgenix Landing Page
This project is about the landing page of the human resources website of Trackgenix SA. 
# HTML
This is the html code of the landing page of Trackgenx SAÂ´s human reources website. Previously designed in Figma.
It has been written using HTML as the basic structure of the page, taking into account all the important elements that a web page as such should have. Having in mind the future clear reading of the code.
# CSS
This is the CSS style sheet of the landing page written in HTML.
It has been coded with the purpose to recreate the exact same layout made previously in Figma. But with the intention of not being responsive at the moment.
